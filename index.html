            <div class="subtitle"><strong >AIR QUALITY SENSOR</strong> <br>
                These sensors work on the principle of measuring the attenuation of infrared radiation (with a specific wave length) in the air. 
              The sensors consist of an infrared radiation source, a light-water pipe and the infrared detector with the appropriate filter.

             A system that handles underground waters and harmful gases are essential to building the system. 
              .  This system monitors the water level and hazard gases. If the drainage system gets blocked and water overflows this blockage will be instinctively recognized by sensors and also collecting the data’s about the hazard gases like Carbon monoxide, Hydrogen sulphate and methane these gases are founded harmful gases to humans lives  </div>

            A gas sensor is a device which detects the presence or concentration of gases in the atmosphere.
              Based on the concentration of the gas the sensor produces a corresponding potential difference by changing the resistance of the material inside the sensor, which can be measured as output voltage  </div>

              Gas sensor is one which comes handy in applications where we have to detect the variation in the concentration of toxic gases in order to maintain the system safe and avoid/caution any unexpected threats. There are various gas sensors to detect gases like oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen, methane etc. They can also be commonly found in devices that are used to detect the leakage of the harmful gases, monitor the air quality in industries and offices etc.  </div>

             Social distancing is a recommended solution by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to minimise the spread of COVID-19 in public places.          The detection model detects humans and gives bounding box information. After human detection, the Euclidean distance between each detected centroid pair is computed using the detected bounding box and its centroid information. A predefined minimum social distance violation threshold is specified using pixel to distance assumptions   </div>
